# Mostro Mobile Client

Super early version of a mobile client for the [Mostro](https://github.com/MostroP2P/mostro) P2P platform.

This project is a mobile interface that facilitates peer-to-peer bitcoin trading over the lightning network ‚ö°Ô∏è using nostr ü¶©. The lightning network is a layer 2 scaling solution for bitcoin that enables fast and low-cost transactions.

- Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (for iOS development)
- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (optional but recommended)

### For Mostro Daemon

- Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### For Testing Environment

- Install [Polar](https://lightningpolar.com/): For simulating Lightning Network nodes
